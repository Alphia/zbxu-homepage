He received his MS degree in mathematics in 1981 from Northwest University, China and PhD degree in applied mathematics in 1987 from Xi`an Jiaotong University, China. He now serves as professor of mathematics and computer science, and&nbsp;director of the Institute for Information and System Sciences. In 2007, he was appointed as a Chief Scientist of National Basic&nbsp;Research Program of China (973 Project).<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His current reserach interest includes&nbsp;intelligent information processing, machine learning and theories in numerical modeling.&nbsp; He proposes the &nbsp;L(1/2) regulation theory, which serves as foundations for sparse microwave imaging. He also discovers and proves Xu-Roach Theom in machine learning, which solves several difficult problems in nueral networks and simulated evolutionary computation，and provides a general deduction criteria for machine learning and nonlinear analysis under Non-Euclidean fromwork. lastly, he initiates new modeling theories and&nbsp;&nbsp;methodologies based on visual cognition, and formulates series of new algorithms for clustering analysis, discriminant analysis, and latent viable analysis, which have been&nbsp;widely&nbsp;applied to science and engineering. He is owner of the National Natural Science Award of China in 2007，and winner of CSIAM Su Buchin Applied Mathematics Prize in 2008. He delivered a sectional talk at International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM 2010) upon the invitation of the congress committee.</span><br />

<font face="Times New Roman">On the formal invitation of Prof. M.S. Raghunathan, Chairman of Organizing Committee of International Congress of Mathematicians, Prof. Zongben Xu&nbsp; given a 45 minute talk at the 26th Congress to be held in Hyderabad, India in 2010.<br />
International Congress of Mathematicians（ICM）is the top event in the mathematical community. It is held once every four years, and the Fields Medals are awarded at the congress’ opening ceremony. As a tradition, outstanding mathematicians are invited to give talks on latest development in related fields. Assigned by the International Mathematic Union, several well-known mathematicians around the world constitute the executive organizing committee. The committee invites 45 minute speakers in the light of the important advancement in the past four years. The invitation for a 45 minute talk is a great honor for a mathematician and it indicates the world-wide recognition for his/her work.<br />
Up till now, less than 20 mathematicians from Chinese mainland have been invited to give 45 minute talks. This invitation for ICM 2010 marks that the work achieved by Prof. Zongben Xu and his team has taken a leading position in the international applied mathematic community.</font></span></p>

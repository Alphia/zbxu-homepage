<p>On the formal invitation of Prof. M.S. Raghunathan, Chairman of Organizing Committee of
    International Congress of Mathematicians, Prof. Zongben Xu given a 45 minute talk at the 26th Congress to be
    held in Hyderabad, India in 2010.</p>
<p>International Congress of Mathematicians（ICM）is the top event in the mathematical community. It is held once every
    four years, and the Fields Medals are awarded at the congress’ opening ceremony. As a tradition, outstanding
    mathematicians are invited to give talks on latest development in related fields. Assigned by the International
    Mathematics Union, several well-known mathematicians around the world constitute the executive organizing committee.
    The committee invites 45 minute speakers in the light of the important advancement in the past four years. The
    invitation for a 45 minute talk is a great honor for a mathematician and it indicates the world-wide recognition for
    his/her work.</p>
<p>Up till now, less than 20 mathematicians from Chinese mainland have been invited to give 45 minute talks. This
    invitation for ICM 2010 marks that the work achieved by Prof. Zongben Xu and his team has taken a leading position
    in the international applied mathematics community.</p>

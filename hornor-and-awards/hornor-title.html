    The project focuses on a study on data modeling, a main procedure of knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining (DM), from the perspective of simulating biological cognition/perception principles. Through more than 20 years’ investigation, our group have made a systematic contribution towards the theories, principles and methodologies of the cognition-based data modeling, highlighted as:<br />
    A new DM principle and methodology inspired from modeling physiological discoveries and psychophysical experiments of primary and higher visual system, which leads to series of effective and efficient scale related clustering, classification and regression algorithms with a psychophsiological basis and interpretation. It provides novel ways to solve the vexing problems of cluster validity check, scale discretization scheme, robustness and parameter settings in DM.<br />
    <br />
    A new data modeling tool, coined as binomial-like formula, for analysis of models and algorithms in non-Euclidean spaces, with which a series of new models and theories of artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed. The developed theories particularly provide solutions of the long-standing problems of stability test of Hopfield-type ANNs, convergence of on-line BP procedure and essential approximation order estimation of feedforward ANNs;An axiomatization approach of simulated evolutionary computation (SEC), which yields a unified and powerful framework of analysis for various simulated evolutionary algorithms (SEAs). Within the framework, convergence of many types of genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies is proven in difference senses.</p>

<p>A law of error propagation of geographical information system (GIS), when applied to geographical data modelling, which forms a rigorous GIS uncertainty analysis methodology, laying the mathematical foundation for the development of GIS products characterized by uncertainty description. The contribution is reflected in 109 academic papers published in international journals of this field, 20 of which are on IEEE Transactions, 75 of which are indexed by SCI. The publications are cited for 1168 times home and abroad, on 117 SCI journals (including 65 papers on journals with impact factor higher than 2) by 384 authors from 33 countries and regions. For examples, J.A. Foster, the famous scientist, introduces one of the project papers to the international genetics community as the representative work of SEC on Nature Reviews journal. One of the project papers published on Neural Network ranks the Download Top 10 of the journal. The paper, in which GIS error propagation theory is proposed, covers the whole issue of J. Geo. Sys. (104 pages). The Binomial-like Formula in non-Euclidean space developed is referred as Xu-Roach Inequality or Xu-Roach Theorem and is used as lemma or preliminary theorem by 28 SCI papers. Project achievers are invited to make special lectures or keynote speeches for 13 times in international conferences. Tow achievers serve as editors for 7 international journals. The contributions of the project take a leading position in the international community and were awarded the First Prize of Natural Science by Ministry of Education in 2006. They have also been applied in academic institutions such as The State Key Lab of Resources and Environment Information System (Chinese Academy of Science), and Grid Computing E-Institute for Universities in Shanghai.</p>

    As the award notification goes, Prof. Xu “is devoted to the interdisciplinary study of mathematics and information science. He has made a great contribution to&nbsp;geometry of &nbsp;Banach spaces and nonlinear operator theory. His achievement is also highlighted by the systematic studies in intelligence information processing, particularly, in machine learning. Several of his works take a lead in the international community, and gain wide recognition. The research findings are applied to research and development sectors of several organizations.”</p>
